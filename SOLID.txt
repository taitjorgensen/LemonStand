SOLID design principles for Lemonade Stand Project

In the areas where my player is asked to purchase inventory,
each method is set up to handle different portions of the purchase process.  
There is a method to purchase inventory, one to update the total available inventory, and another to update the available funds.  
This was done to allow for additional ingredients to be added, or variations to how the inventory would be handled.  
This would demonstrate the Single Responsibility Principle.

The way I designed classes to contain only the needed information for certain processes is an example of Open-Closed Principle.  
The inventory class does not contain the pitcher, it was left with just available ingredients. 
The pitcher does not have inventory, only the ingredients that the player decided to use to pour a glass of lemonade.
For this example, the inventory could be changed to make different drinks, or the pitcher could be made to hold more or less of a beverage.
